The SOURCE repository contains two branches: one for Sublime Text build < 3153,
and another for after that. We are using the < 3153 version (`.tmLanguage`
converted to `.sublime-syntax` via Sublime Text 3).

It is not clear to me why, but the `new` branch version does not work with
Syntect on most vue files. e.g.:

[this one](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli/blob/bfebc6d934926c9080b09107c13ede5dca4d6bab/packages/%40vue/cli-ui-addon-webpack/src/components/ModuleListItem.vue#L13)

It produces a Syntect error:

```
thread '<unnamed>' panicked at 'Can only call resolve on linked references: ByScope { scope: <source.stylus>, sub_context: None }', /Users/stephen/.cargo/git/checkouts/syntect-eae6a61cc0258c3f/84dd225/src/parsing/syntax_definition.rs:205:18
```

I suspect it is due to the syntax using a new feature (yaml macros?) that the
Sublime version supports but Syntect doesn't.
